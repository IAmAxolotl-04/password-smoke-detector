5.  Test Vectors

   The following JSON artifacts are generated by the CSP hasher for RFC purposes:

   - `docs/rfc/test-vectors.json` : Contains example password inputs and expected hash prefixes.
   - `docs/rfc/protocol-metadata.json` : Contains collision probabilities and protocol metadata.

   Clients and servers may use these vectors to verify correct implementations.
